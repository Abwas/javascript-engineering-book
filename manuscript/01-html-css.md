# Chapter 1 - HTML & CSS

## Introduction
In this chapter, we will start our path towards becoming a professional JavaScript Engineer/Developer!

For this, is extremely necessary learn very well the foundational technologies of the Web: HTML, CSS and of course, JavaScript.

Working together through a variety of resources, in the end of this chapter, we will have the ability to build professional user interfaces with semantic and maintainable code.

Let's get started!

## Summary - Chapter 1: HTML & CSS

- Learn to Code HTML & CSS
- FreeCodeCamp - HTML5 and CSS
- PostCSS

## Learn to Code HTML & CSS

The first resource that we will use is the website [Learn to Code HTML & CSS - Develop & Style Websites](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/).

Go to that site and read the first lesson: [Building Your First Web Page](http://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/building-your-first-web-page/). After you finish, return to here and follow with our extra exercises based on that chapter.

T> **Copy**, **Modify** and **Create**!

Finished your introduction to HTML and CSS? **Great!!!** Now let's go to our step 2, **Modify**.

Before we delve in our project that will be made in parallel with the "Styles Conference", let's answer some questions to solidify our knowledge and to help internalize the concepts learned in the previous lesson.

> The answer will be below the question to facilitate your verification. Try to not read it before you think in the answer :)

Q> ## What is an Element in HTML?
Q>
Q> **Answer:** An Element is an individual component of our page. It could be a paragraph, a heading, a division, and so on. With several elements combined together, we are able to structure a web page to represent what we want.

Q> ## What is a Tag in HTML
Q>
Q> **Answer:** A Tag in HTML is a markup that represents an Element. This is actually the blocks that we will use to construct our page. Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.

Q> ## What is an Attribute in HTML?
Q>
Q> **Answer:** An Attribute in HTML is a property that we use to provide additional information about an element.

We will create the User Interface for a Library Management System based on the steps that we followed in the previous resource, but now with a slightly difference, I'll list the steps that you have to do, and you will implement this based on those specifications.

If you have some problem, you will be able to see the source code and the live demo of this application as well, but just look the final solution after you finish yours, or try several times to acomplish it.

X> Let's create the foundation of our user interface as we did in the Styles Conference app.

1. Create a directory called `ls-ui` (**L**ibrary **S**ystem - **U**ser **I**nterface).

REMINDER: Discuss about "throwaways apps".
